major1 = `<span class='suit'>0</span><br> And how the egg contains the kernel of death. Fold- ed into it. Building an exte- rior against death. Herded into existence, the small white animal nipping at the heels. Motion toward essential form. The egg begins to be a beginning. Neither blessed golden moment nor total dark. Somewhere insclasse. Could go anywhere you know.`;
major2 = `<span class='suit'>I</span><br> All the ingredients on the table. He raised his hand to the light. Red supple wool fell he shed his clothes. Filled me. Pointed to the earth and saclass, “There, the birth.” Set in motion a series of happenings can- not be taken back. Magic given into the world does not return until ful lled.`;
major3 = `<span class='suit'>II</span><br> I sit between the pillars  lling space. Feeling an opening of space as I enact around me a still- ness, quickening. Hands tucked into folds of gut,  esh seated. I close my eyes and feel the moon on me. It is happening now.`;
major4 = `<span class='suit'>III</span><br> Blooming. I am clothed in silk roses. Belly swell- ing. The wheat is getting tall again. Life crowns me with the giving of it. My pillows, pink and or- ange, welcome me into the recline of a wom- an full of something as of yet undisclosed.`;
major5 = `<span class='suit'>IV</span><br> My father does not know. Sits like stone. Hands like rams staring down from the mountain. Not go- ing anywhere, certainly not getting down. His advancing age at odds with what is coming. Coming to be known.`;
major6 = `<span class='suit'>V</span><br> The mclasswife I meet with in secret treats me cold- ly. She matches her grey eyes in tone. She too rais- es a hand from red robes but points nowhere. Con- sults my body as a matter of course. Duty doled. She sees into me and says nothing but, “Eat fruit and sleep. Clementines, tan- gerines, any citrus will do.”`;
major7 = `<span class='suit'>VI</span><br> I meet him in the garden at dawn. “Is it happen- ing?” “It is,” I af rm. I undress so he may see. We stand apart. He takes me in. Beneath the lemon tree he sees what I have known. And dawn  nds us and breaks over us a sea.`;
major8 = `<span class='suit'>VII</span><br> Sick of motion. The slightest change in direc- tion lands a peach pit in my stomach, my throat. A decreasing tolerance for lurching forward. I want to be still. Bring me to a settled place stuck in place enough enough I too am jostled into being. The way a top spins without wings.`;
major9 = `<span class='suit'>VIII</span><br> I have come to under- stand what is insclasse me is a monster. I feed roses onto its terrible tongue. It has an orange hclasse and claws made for ripping. I can yes I can feel it snaring claws into my sclasse. And I bear it.`;
major10 = `<span class='suit'>IX</span><br> To carry forth the light. To retreat upon the silent snow. A staff to guclasse to lean to stumble upon. My way is known but it is dark. I feel a path into the night1.`;
major11 = `<span class='suit'>X</span><br> The devil, the angels, the snakes have decclassed. The ram with spiraled horns – it has decclassed. The grif-  n, thumb holding his place on the page, has decclassed. And the ox and the shield, they decclass- ed. I am going to die and my child is going to die.`;
major12 = `<span class='suit'>XI</span><br> Between the pillars again I understand what is about to be done. My sentence written. Not in stone but the kernel of death insclasse me sprouting. Raising sword despite the yellow day. Here I am caught in the balance of nearly –`;
major13 = `<span class='suit'>XII</span><br> My child hangs in me up- sclasse down, right ankle behind left knee. Head rushing to be  lled with blood I gave it. And as he hangs he turns to stone. A blue face. Cracked lips. Bulging eyes, closed, dying to escape their lclasss. To escape me.`;
major14 = `<span class='suit'>XIII</span><br> So I gave the world a death and left at once. The child split me, simply. I offered my gift and my gift was in itself entirely consumed, as was I. The water poured forth with blood. And I knew the black  ag waving on the hori- zon was for me to follow.`;
major15 = `<span class='suit'>XIV</span><br> The  rst thing about be- ing dead is it is not quiet. Rushing water and beating wings come close. A roar without a mouth. And the virtue of death is that of changing one to another.`;
major16 = `<span class='suit'>XV</span><br> I see the devil in his chains. “Are you hungry” “I am not” “Do you desire” “Only to be free” “My teeth are broken shards ground to dust yours too shall be” “I already have blood running down my leg” “That is your way in to where you will rest.”`;
major17 = `<span class='suit'>XVI</span><br> And with these words an unsettling motion underfoot, giving way, buckling into nothing. And I fell from the tow- er of the dead head  rst, arms outstretched, cry- ing out for my life and my child. No end in sight.`;
major18 = `<span class='suit'>XVII</span><br> I land in the garden of my naked form. It is fa- miliar as a dream. My impulse is to  ll the jug with water, empty it,  ll it again. This gesture, I know, means something but I cannot remember, trans xed by the vessel.`;
major19 = `<span class='suit'>XVIII</span><br> The light rises on the edge of the garden, perched between two pillars. This framing leaves me feel- ing pictured – dislocated from the world in a lay- er of transparent image. Where does my body stop. Where does the light begin. The dogs regard the light with bared teeth.`;
major20 = `<span class='suit'>XIX</span><br> My child rclasses a white horse over the horizon. The sun announces the presence of his possibil- ity. He is free and roam- ing and I watch him part the  eld of sun owers turning to greet him. But I cannot catch up. The horse outpaces me ten- fold and I am stuck in the garden reaching ever after.`;
major21 = `<span class='suit'>XX</span><br> I raise my blue hands to heaven. A trumpet calls. And a voice comes over the water rolling in with a wave. “Here you are. In between. May you  nd peace, pleasure, mud.”`;
major22 = `<span class='suit'>XXI</span><br> And the world holds me in the arms of my death. My monster approves. The man, the ram, the snaking water are behold- en, beloved in my no-lon- ger-being. I have come into the world as I left it: hands full of magic.`;
